  <h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Safety Precautions during a Natural Disaster</h1>
    <section class="content"><h2 class="name">General Preparedness</h2>
    <p><ul><li>Emergency Kit: Prepare an emergency kit with essentials like water, non-perishable food, medications, flashlight, batteries, first aid supplies, important documents, and cash.</li>
      <li>Communication Plan: Establish a family communication plan, including how to get in touch with each other and where to meet if separated.</li>
      <li>Stay Informed: Keep up with weather alerts and warnings through radio, TV, or a reliable mobile app.</li></ul>
      </p></section>
    <section class="content"><h2 class="name"> Earthquakes</h2>
    <p><ul><li>Drop, Cover, and Hold On: During shaking, drop to your hands and knees, cover your head and neck with your arms, and take shelter under a sturdy table or against an interior wall. Hold on until the shaking stops.</li>
<li>Stay Indoors: If you're indoors, stay there. If outdoors, move to an open area away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires.</li>
<li>After the Shaking Stops: Be prepared for aftershocks. Check yourself and others for injuries and provide first aid if needed. Evacuate the building if it’s unsafe.</li></ul>
</p></section>
    <section class="content"><h2 class="name"> Floods</h2><p>
      <ul><li>Move to Higher Ground: If you’re in a flood-prone area, move to higher ground immediately.</li>
     <li>Avoid Floodwaters: Don’t walk, swim, or drive through floodwaters. Just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.</li>
      <li>Turn Off Utilities: If time permits, turn off utilities at the main switches or valves.</li></ul>
    </p></section>

    </p></section>
    <section class="content"><h2 class="name">Tornadoes</h2><p>
      Seek Shelter: Go to a small, windowless interior room on the lowest level of your home, like a basement or storm cellar. If you're in a mobile home, evacuate to a sturdier building.<br>
Cover Your Head: Protect yourself from flying debris by covering your head and neck with your arms.<br>
Stay Low: Crouch down and stay low to the ground.<br>

    </p></section>
    <section class="content"><h2 class="name">Wildfires</h2><p>
      Evacuate Early: If there's a wildfire nearby, evacuate as soon as possible. Don't wait for official orders if you feel unsafe.<br>
      Protect Your Home: Remove flammable materials from your yard, close all doors and windows, and turn off gas supplies if possible.<br>
      Wear Protective Clothing: If you're caught outside, wear protective clothing to shield yourself from heat and embers. <br>

Prevent Carbon Monoxide Poisoning: Never use a generator, grill, or camp stove indoors.<br>

      Stay Away from the Volcano: Avoid areas downwind and downstream of the volcano. <br>

    <section class="content"><h2 class="name">Tsunamis</h2><p>
